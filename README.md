AwesomePrelude - Documentation branch
=====================================

Documentation branch of the AwesomePrelude project. Storing old presentations and the like.


_Note_: I'm no git expert, and I'm not sure if this is the correct way to go about this.  
But this way we can have the source code separated from junk like presentations.
